how can we capture similarities between two words? 
we look at features of two words. 
If we can derive some features for objects then we can compare the similarities between them. 

How to translate words to features?
we create vectors and compare them
These feature vectors are called word embeddings. 
word2vec is one of the way to create word embeddings. 

BERT can generate contextualized embeddings 
bert can generate embeddings for entire sentence usually of 768 lenth.
