I have three visions for India. In 3000 years of our history, people from all over 
the world have come and invaded us, captuour lands, conquered our minds. 
From Alexander onwards, the Greeks, the Turthe Moguls, the Portuguese, the British,
the French, the Dutch, all of them came looted us, took over what was ours. 
Yet we have not done this to any other natiWe have not conquered anyone. 
We have not grabbed their land, their culture, 
their history and tried to enforce our waylife on them. 
Why? Because we respect the freedom of othThat is why my 
first vision is that of freedom. I belithat India got its first vision of 
this in 1857, when we started the WarIndependence. It is this freedom that
we must protect and nurture and build on.we are not free, no one will respect us.
My second vision for India’s development. fifty years we have been a developing nation.
It is time we see ourselves as a develonation. We are among the top 5 nations of world
in terms of GDP. We have a 10 percent grorate in most areas. Our poverty levels falling.
Our achievements are being globally recognitoday. Yet we lack the self-confidence to
see ourselves as a developed natiself-reliant and self-assured. Isn’t tincorrect?
I have a third vision. India must stand upthe world. Because I believe that unless India 
stands up to the world, no one will respus. Only strength respects strength. We mbe 
strong not only as a military power but aas an economic power. Both musthand-in-hand.
